Thanks to [@NamitBhutani](https://github.com/NamitBhutani) for this.

### Selecting lectures

When prompted to enter a range do the following

-   Enter the numbers shown on the left (not the lecture number after "LEC")
-   If you want lectures from 1 to 10, this is how your input will be `1 10`. The range is inclusive.
-   If you want only 1 lecture say 5, your input should be `5 5`.
-   Make sure you add space between the start and end.

## Configuration

The comments beside the fields tell the allowed values.

```jsonc
{
    "username": "uid@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in",
    "password": "password",

    "slides": false, // Accepted values: true, false to download the slides from impartus,
    "numWorkers": 5 // Number of workers to use set this to 1 if you want to download the videos sequentially. Setting this to 0 will use a default number that is 5
}
```

## FAQ/Troubleshooting

### What is the project status?

This project is(was) in a working state. It is not being actively maintained as I have graduated. If you find any issues, feel free to open an issue or a PR. I will try to help if I can.

### How do I run this?

Refer to the [How to use](#how-to-use) section.

### IT IS NOT WORKING!!!!

-   Make sure you have the latest version.
-   Make sure you have the correct username and password.
-   Make sure you have the correct baseUrl.
-   Make sure you have ffmpeg installed and in your PATH.
-   Make sure the website is working.

Despite all of them being correct if it is not working, open an issue.

### I changed the credentials but it is not giving me data for the new credentials

Delete the `.token` file. This was a mistake on my part. The program caches the token and does not check for new credentials. This may or may not be fixed in the future.

### Does it download both the views?

Yes. It downloaded both the views if they are available and are selected in the `config.json`.

### How do I change to different views in [insert software name]?

You are on your own here. I use `mpv` and it has a shortcut key https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8065 for the same. For `VLC` the functionality is available from my understanding in some menu. For other software, you will have to look it up.

### How to download slides?

Set `slides` value to `true` in `config.json`.

### Where are my slides???

The slides are located in the same folder as the videos.
